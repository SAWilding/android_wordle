# Overview

To demonstrate my understanding of the Kotlin programming language, I developed an android app.  The app is of the popular word game, Wordle.  The player is given 6 guesses to guess a random five letter word.  The player is given hints based on the word they guess.  

Completing this project helped me learn Kotlin and prepare me for a future software development career.  

Here is a video demonstration of my software
